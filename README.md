Exploring probability concepts using Python: Law of Large Numbers, Bayes' Theorem, and Simulations

The Goal
I am investigating how empirical probability approaches theoretical probability as the number of trials increases.

Key Concepts
Theoretical Probability: For a fair coin, P(H) = 0.5.
Law of Large Numbers: As n --> infinity , the sample mean will converge to the theoretical mean.




# Monty Hall Simulation
This script simulates the famous Monty Hall problem. It demonstrates that the probability of winning is significantly higher (66.6%) if the contestant chooses to switch doors after a goat is revealed, compared to staying with their initial choice (33.3%).
