Exploring probability concepts using Python: Law of Large Numbers, Bayes' Theorem, and Simulations

The Goal
I am investigating how empirical probability approaches theoretical probability as the number of trials increases.

Key Concepts
Theoretical Probability: For a fair coin, P(H) = 0.5.
Law of Large Numbers: As n --> infinity , the sample mean will converge to the theoretical mean.
